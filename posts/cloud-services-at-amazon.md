My role mostly involved the development of our teams tooling. This included Object Oriented Python API’s, JavaScript clients and Serverless cronjobs. All cloud native development with infrastructure deployed as code through automated pipelines with senior code reviews and extensive testing.

My role also included the automation of various, large scale, cloud infrastructure tasks for major international clients using AWS CLI, AWS SDK, Boto3, CloudFormation, AWS Systems Manager, Lambda, Serverless Application Model, etc.

My biggest achievement was designing, building and owning a tool that completely replaced our products change management CLI client with a much faster, simpler and more secure JavaScript client. This is now used daily by over 250 operation engineers in 6 sites globally.
