Vyra is an exciting startup educating employee's on sustainability and creating cultures of sustainability within companies. After validating their product with some large enterprises I came in to help them start building their new tech platform from scratch. This included a tech strategy, how to approach and cost their tech challenge, and a tech architecture, how to design the platform. This lasted a month and resulted in Vyra getting funding for their tech strategy, getting a good partner onboard to build the platform and getting a head start on the build.
